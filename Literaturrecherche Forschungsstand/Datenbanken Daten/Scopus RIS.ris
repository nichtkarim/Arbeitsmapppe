AB  - As the amount of data continues to grow, with images becoming larger in terms of bytes and details across scientific, photography, industrial, medical, gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), autonomous systems, and digital content creation domains, and as generative AI (Gen AI) and large language models (LLMs) gain popularity, the computational demands on modern systems have reached unprecedented levels. In this work, we introduce optimized, GPU-parallelized image processing algorithms that significantly reduce computation requirements, improving both processing speed and scalability. Additionally, in our work, edge computing plays a critical role in reducing latency and bandwidth consumption, enabling real-time decision-making by processing data at the edge, closer to the source. Scalable cloud architectures further support this approach by providing elastic, high-throughput processing capabilities for data-intensive tasks. Moreover, in many applications such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicle perception, satellite image analysis, high-precision manufacturing, robotics, and real-time anomaly detection, image review by humans is not only error-prone but also time-consuming, often limiting scalability and response times. To address this, we present a human-in-the-loop (HITL) automation framework, coupled with a UX-centric, GUI-based system, that reduces human workload by 82%, making high-throughput image review feasible even at the scale required for cutting-edge applications like medical imaging, digital marketplaces, platform integrity, semiconductor manufacturing, autonomous systems, precision agriculture, and industrial defect detection. This framework leverages GPU-accelerated computer vision, edge computing, and scalable cloud infrastructure to optimize data processing across the entire cycle, from initial capture to real-time analysis and decision-making. To demonstrate this approach, we utilize challenging images characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), defects, focus variations, and contrast inconsistencies. For this purpose, we selected a dataset of nanometer-resolution images, including ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. These images, captured at the physical limits of SEM technology, contain nanometer-scale details essential for device performance but are characterized by extreme noise, focus variations, and high pixel density. This makes them ideal for evaluating the limits of real-time, high-precision image processing algorithms. Even though these high-variability images exhibit extremely low SNR, they are critical for lithography process control, defect detection, and optical proximity correction (OPC) modeling in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Traditional review methods, such as manual inspection and critical dimension (CD)-based modeling, are not only slow and prone to human error but also limited to localized measurements, often missing critical pattern variations that impact device performance. As the industry moves toward contour-based modeling, which requires analyzing entire images to capture edge roughness, line width variation, and pattern fidelity, there is a growing demand for fully automated, GPU-accelerated, cloud-scalable AI-driven solutions capable of processing this highly complex data efficiently. In our work, the use case of nanometer-resolution SEM images provides a compelling demonstration of the framework's capabilities in handling extremely complex data. Additionally, this paper presents a novel GPU-accelerated machine learning (ML) and AI-powered digital image processing framework for automated image and data refinement and defect detection. The system generates high-resolution pattern fidelity and defect maps by leveraging structural similarity with AI-enhanced adaptive reference models. Key features include AI-driven extrema counting, sharpness metrics, noise level evaluation, and line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) analysis. These features are extracted to cluster images into quality-based groups, enabling real-time defect classification through cloud-scalable hierarchical clustering that surpasses CD-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. A critical limitation of conventional filtering is its reliance on multiple images per process condition (exposure and focus) to identify outliers. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing an AI-powered clustering approach capable of detecting failures, even when only a single image is available per process window condition, eliminating the need for rule-based filtering. This method integrates AI-driven LER and LWR evaluation to ensure robust clustering across varying process conditions, improving both detection accuracy and operational efficiency. To further streamline image and data analysis, the framework includes a GPU-accelerated, edge computing, cloud-integrated graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time, high-performance computing (HPC)-optimized data and image analysis, feature extraction, classification, edge detection, segmentation, data cleaning, measurement, anomaly detection, and defect identification. This solution, integrated into Calibre SEMSuite™, supports multi-cloud deployment for enhanced scalability, usability, and performance, providing users with a powerful tool for fully automated, AI-driven image classification, making high-throughput image review feasible even at the scale required for cutting-edge applications. By integrating these advanced capabilities, the proposed framework not only addresses the computational challenges of modern AI-driven image processing but also significantly reduces human intervention, paving the way for scalable, real-time AI processing in diverse applications such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicle perception, satellite image analysis, high-precision manufacturing, robotics, and real-time anomaly detection. © 2025 SPIE.

AB  - Traditionally, sports commentators provide viewers with diverse information, encompassing in-game developments and player performances. Yet young adult football viewers increasingly use mobile devices for deeper insights during football matches. Such insights into players on the pitch and performance statistics support viewers' understanding of game stakes, creating a more engaging viewing experience. Inspired by commentators' traditional roles and to incorporate information into a single platform, we developed AiCommentator, a Multimodal Conversational Agent (MCA) for embedded visualization and conversational interactions in football broadcast video. AiCommentator integrates embedded visualization, either with an automated non-interactive or with a responsive interactive commentary mode. Our system builds upon multimodal techniques, integrating computer vision and large language models, to demonstrate ways for designing tailored, interactive sports-viewing content. AiCommentator's event system infers game states based on a multi-object tracking algorithm and computer vision backend, facilitating automated responsive commentary. We address three key topics: evaluating young adults' satisfaction and immersion across the two viewing modes, enhancing viewer understanding of in-game events and players on the pitch, and devising methods to present this information in a usable manner. In a mixed-method evaluation (n=16) of AiCommentator, we found that the participants appreciated aspects of both system modes but preferred the interactive mode, expressing a higher degree of engagement and satisfaction. Our paper reports on our development of AiCommentator and presents the results from our user study, demonstrating the promise of interactive MCA for a more engaging sports viewing experience. Systems like AiCommentator could be pivotal in transforming the interactivity and accessibility of sports content, revolutionizing how sports viewers engage with video content. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Background: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, driven by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), has transformed natural language processing. Prompt engineering plays a key role in guiding model outputs effectively. Our primary objective was to explore the possibilities and limitations of a custom GPT, developed via prompt engineering, as a patient education tool, which delivers publicly available information through a user-friendly design that facilitates more effective access to cervical cancer screening knowledge. Method: The system was developed using the OpenAI GPT-4 model and Python programming language, with the interface built on Streamlit for cloud-based accessibility and testing. It initially presented questions to testers for preliminary assessment. For cervical cancer-related information, we referenced medical guidelines. Iterative testing optimized the prompts for quality and relevance; techniques like context provision, question chaining, and prompt-based constraints were used. Human-in-the-loop and two independent medical doctor evaluations were employed. Additionally, system performance metrics were measured. Result: The web application was tested 115 times over a three-week period in 2024, with 87 female (76%) and 28 male (24%) participants. A total of 112 users completed the user experience questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between age and perceived personalization (p = 0.047) and between gender and system customization (p = 0.037). Younger participants reported higher engagement, though not significantly. Females valued guidance on screening schedules and early detection, while males highlighted the usefulness of information regarding HPV vaccination and its role in preventing HPV-related cancers. Independent evaluations by medical doctors demonstrated consistent assessments of the system’s responses in terms of accuracy, clarity, and usefulness. Discussion: While the system demonstrates potential to enhance public health awareness and promote preventive behaviors, encouraging individuals to seek information on cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, its conversational capabilities remain constrained by the inherent limitations of current language model technology. Conclusions: Although custom GPTs can not substitute a healthcare consultations, these tools can streamline workflows, expedite information access, and support personalized care. Further research should focus on conducting well-designed randomized controlled trials to establish definitive conclusions regarding its impact and reliability. Clinical trial number: Not applicable. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This paper introduces CWGPT, a ChatGPT-4-based tool designed for Cognitive Walkthrough (CW) inspired evaluations of web interfaces. The primary goal is to assist users, particularly students and inexperienced designers, in evaluating web interfaces. Our tool, operating as a conversational agent, provides detailed evaluations of a user-specified task by intelligently guessing the subtasks and actions required to accomplish them, answering the standard CW questions, and providing helpful feedback and practical suggestions to improve the usability of the analyzed interface. For our study, we selected a group of web applications designed by students from a Web and Software Architecture course. We compare the outcome of the CWs we executed on ten web apps against the corresponding CWGPT analyses. We then describe the study we conducted involving five author-students to assess the tool's efficacy in helping them recognize and solve usability issues. In addition to introducing a novel adaptation of ChatGPT, the outcomes of the described experience underscore the promising potential of AI in usability evaluations. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Evaluating conversational assistants, such as GitHub Copilot Chat, poses a significant challenge for tool builders in the domain of Software Engineering. These assistants rely on language models and chat-based user experiences, rendering their evaluation with respect to the quality of the Human-AI conversations complicated. Existing general-purpose metrics for measuring conversational quality found in literature are inadequate for appraising domain-specific dialogues due to their lack of contextual sensitivity. In this paper, we present RUBICON, a technique for evaluating domain-specific Human-AI conversations. RUBICON leverages large language models to generate candidate rubrics for assessing conversation quality and employs a selection process to choose the subset of rubrics based on their performance in scoring conversations. In our experiments, RUBICON effectively learns to differentiate conversation quality, achieving higher accuracy and yield rates than existing baselines. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The primary goal of Recommender Systems is to suggest the most suitable items to a user, aligning them with the user’s interests and needs. RSs are essential for modern e-commerce, helping users discover content and products by predicting suitable items based on their past behavior. However, their success isn’t just about advanced algorithms. The design of the user interface and a good integration with the human decision-making process are equally crucial. A well-designed interface enhances the user experience and makes recommendations more effective, while a poor interface can lead to frustration. Recognizing this limitation, recent trends in Recommender Systems (RSs) are increasingly focusing on integrating Symbiotic Human-Machine Decision-Making models. These models aim to offer users a dynamic and persuasive interface that helps them better understand and engage with recommendations. This shift is a crucial step toward developing recommender systems that truly connect with users and offer a more enjoyable, trustworthy, explainable, and user-friendly experience. Although early efforts concentrated on creating systems that could proactively predict user preferences and needs, modern RSs also emphasize the importance of providing users with control and transparency over their recommendations. Finding the right balance between proactivity and user control is essential to ensure that the system supports users without being too intrusive, thus improving their overall satisfaction. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into recommender systems, the importance of user-centric interfaces and a deep understanding of decision-making becomes even more critical. Effective integration of LLMs requires interfaces that are both visually and cognitively engaging. These aspects are the main discussion topics of the Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at RecSys’24. In this summary, we introduce the motivation and perspective of the workshop, review its history, and discuss the most critical issues that deserve attention for future research directions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Smartifier is a conversational platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help non-technical users design, implement, and manage smart objects. It addresses persistent challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, where the “making community” and End-User Development approaches have yet to empower novices fully. The system features two distinct chat interfaces: one dedicated to creating customized devices, and another for generating automation rules. Building on an iterative design model, Smartifier translates high-level, daily-life needs into hardware selections and automatically compiled software, ensuring correct APIs for seamless integration. A technical evaluation compared different ChatGPT-based models and temperature values, revealing an optimal configuration that curbs hallucinations and maximizes reliability. In a user study with 17 participants lacking ICT expertise, Smartifier achieved high correctness (averaging over 91% across all tasks) and high scores regarding usability and user satisfaction. A thematic analysis of conversations revealed insights around user need expression, iterative negotiation, and system feedback. These findings will inform future refinements, especially regarding user experience design and the handling of advanced functionalities in complex real-world settings. While the study’s sample size is limited, findings confirm that Smartifier effectively bridges complex technical tasks and everyday needs, reducing cognitive load and streamlining the creation of IoT solutions. These results highlight the potential of LLM-driven platforms to simplify and democratize technology development, suggesting new directions for future research on EUD and software generation for non-expert users. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The quality of user interface (UI) design directly impacts product usability and user experience. Designers often face challenges related to consistency and accessibility during the UI design process, increasing cognitive load for users reducing efficiency. Despite awareness of these issues, they currently lack comprehensive knowledge and tools or automatic identification and resolution. To address this challenge, a comprehensive set of UI design evaluation criteria was proposed, covering five key aspects: color, text, layout, control, and icon, specifically targeting consistency and accessibility issues in UI design. Based on these evaluation criteria, a prompt template for evaluating UI consistency and accessibility was developed to enhance the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in UI evaluation tasks. Furthermore, a UI evaluation system based on the GPT-4 model was developed. This [26] deeply understood UI design content, automatically detected UI design issues according to the evaluation criteria, and provided targeted improvement suggestions to help designers optimize their UI designs.

AB  - Mobile applications and devices became widely popular in the second decade of the 21st century, mostly driven by technologies like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and big data, leading to and fostering very fast paced development cycles of cloud-based mobile apps, which offer enhanced convenience and accessibility for end users. However, significant security challenges remain, as cybersecurity is often overlooked in favor of a shorter time-to-market. This paper presents the Security by Design for the Cloud and Mobile Ecosystem framework, consisting of a set of tools and underlying logic aimed at helping mobile application developers build secure applications in the specific mobile and cloud ecosystem. It features a modular architecture and includes five main tools built in Python, and its outputs are enhanced through the use of ChatGPT. The paper also discusses real-world applications and presents usability evaluation results, showing the framework is effective and meets its goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This workshop aims to design advanced empathic user interfaces for in-vehicle displays, particularly for high-level automated vehicles (SAE level 3 or higher). Incorporating model-based approaches for understanding human emotion regulation, it seeks to enhance the user-vehicle interaction. A unique aspect of this workshop is the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the design process. The workshop will explore generative AI's potential in crafting contextual responses and its impact on user experience and interface design. The agenda includes brainstorming on various driving scenarios, developing emotion-oriented intervention methods, and rapid prototyping with AI tools. The anticipated outcome includes practical prototypes of affective user interfaces and insights on the role of AI in designing human-machine interactions. Through this workshop, we hope to contribute to making automated driving more accessible and enjoyable. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Mixed Reality (MR) technologies have transformed the way in which we interact and engage with digital content, offering immersive experiences that blend the physical and virtual worlds. Over the past years, there has been increasing interest in employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to improve user experience and trustworthiness in cultural contexts. However, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into MR applications within the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain is relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an investigation into the integration of LLMs within MR environments, focusing on the context of virtual art exhibitions. We implemented a HoloLens MR application, which enables users to explore artworks while interacting with an LLM through voice. To evaluate the user experience and perceived trustworthiness of individuals engaging with an LLM-based virtual art guide, we adopted a between-subject study design, in which participants were randomly assigned to either the LLM-based version or a control group using conventional interaction methods. The LLM-based version allows users to pose inquiries about the artwork displayed, ranging from details about the creator to information about the artwork's origin and historical significance. This paper presents the technical aspects of integrating LLMs within MR applications and evaluates the user experience and perceived trustworthiness of this approach in enhancing the exploration of virtual art exhibitions. Results of an initial evaluation provide evidence about the positive aspect of integrating LLMs in MR applications. Findings of this work contribute to the advancement of MR technologies for the development of future interactive personalized art experiences. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - From ELIZA to Alexa, Conversational Agents (CAs) have been deliberately designed to elicit or project empathy. Although empathy can help technology better serve human needs, it can also be deceptive and potentially exploitative. In this work, we characterize empathy in interactions with CAs, highlighting the importance of distinguishing evocations of empathy between two humans from ones between a human and a CA. To this end, we systematically prompt CAs backed by large language models (LLMs) to display empathy while conversing with, or about, 65 distinct human identities, and also compare how different LLMs display or model empathy. We find that CAs make value judgments about certain identities, and can be encouraging of identities related to harmful ideologies (e.g., Nazism and xenophobia). Moreover, a computational approach to understanding empathy reveals that despite their ability to display empathy, CAs do poorly when interpreting and exploring a user's experience, contrasting with their human counterparts. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - NodeGrade tries to provide a suitable solution for the problem of time-intensive short answer grading. This research focuses simultaneously on performance, functionality and user experience, which is underlined by a triangulated approach. The evaluation results show comparable performance of NodeGrade on public datasets, even outperforming GPT-4 on the SemEval 2013 Task 7. Matching of NodeGrade’s output with multiple human expert raters reveals some weaknesses regarding cases at the lower and upper boundary. In terms of user experience, the interviewed and observed students recognized both positive facets, like better learning support and helpful feedback, and negative sides, including technical limitations and lack of transparency. Overall, NodeGrade promises high potential for further practical use and testing in the field of software engineering education and automatic short answer grading. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In today’s business landscape, Chatbots play a pivotal role in innovation and process optimization. In this paper, we introduced a novel advanced Emotional Chatbot AI, introducing sentiment analysis for human chatbot conversations. Adding an emotional component within the human-computer interaction, can in fact dramatically improve the quality of the final conversation between Chatbots and humans. More specifically, in our paper, we provided a practical evaluation of the EmoROBERTA software, introducing it into a novel implementation of an Emotional Chatbot. The pipeline we present is novel, and we developed it within a business context in which the use of sentimental and emotional responses can act in a significant and fundamental way toward the final success and use of the Chatbot itself. The architecture enriches user experience with real-time updates on the topic of interest, maintaining a user-centric design, toward an affective-response enhancement of the interaction established between the Chatbot and the user.

AB  - Intent-based networking has attracted interest in the academic research for enhancing network management operations with user-oriented features. One of the main challenge in this field is the acquisition of the user intents and subsequently the relative translation into policies for the automatic management of the network. Concerning this task, the primary technique employed is relying on Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)s. In addition, the use of Natural Language Processing techniques has been extensively adopted for improved user experience. Recently, some preliminary studies have shown that using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose leads to achieve interesting results. However, based on a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art, it has emerged that the works utilizing the LLMs do not fully exploit all the capabilities these tools could potentially offer. For this reason, the doctoral work aims to address the following challenges: enhancing user experience through the utilization of intelligent chatbots, improving the correct understanding of user intents and ensuring the translation of user intentions into a coherent set of network configurations, which are generated automatically. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With ChatGPT's release, conversational prompting has become the most popular form of human-LLM interaction. However, its effectiveness is limited for more complex tasks involving reasoning, creativity, and iteration. Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow-planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing-to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the "5W1H" guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How). We anticipate this taxonomy will contribute to the future design and evaluation of human-LLM interaction. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.

AB  - Student peer review writing is prevalent and important in education for fostering critical thinking and learning motivation. However, it often entails challenges such as high effort and writer's block. Leaving students unsupported may thus diminish the efficacy of the process. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential remedy, but their utility hinges on user-centered design. Guided by design-determining constructs from the Cognitive Process Theory of Writing, we developed an intelligent writing support tool to alleviate these challenges, aiding 1) ideation and 2) evaluation. A randomized experiment (n=120) confirmed users were less inclined to utilize the tool's intelligent features when offered pre-supplied ideas or evaluations, validating our approach. Moreover, students engaged not less but more with their writing if support was available, indicating an enhanced experience. Our research illuminates design choices for enhancing LLM-based tools' usability and user experience, specifically optimizing intelligent writing support tools to facilitate student peer review. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various natural language processing tasks, but their effectiveness for app review classification to support software evolution remains unexplored. This study evaluates commercial and open-source LLMs for classifying mobile app reviews into bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and ratings. We compare the zero-shot performance of GPT-3.5 and Gemini Pro 1.0, finding that GPT-3.5 achieves superior results with an F1 score of 0.849. We then use GPT-3.5 to autonomously annotate a dataset for fine-tuning smaller open-source models. Experiments with Llama 2 and Mistral show that instruction fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with results approaching commercial models. We investigate the trade-off between training data size and the number of epochs, demonstrating that comparable results can be achieved with smaller datasets and increased training iterations. Additionally, we explore the impact of different prompting strategies on model performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance app review analysis for software engineering while highlighting areas for further improvement in open-source alternatives. © 2025 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The maturation of internet usage environments has elevated User Experience (UX) to a critical factor in system success. However, traditional manual UX testing methods are hampered by subjectivity and lack of standardization, resulting in time-consuming and costly processes. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by developing an automated UX testing tool. Our innovative approach integrates the Rapi web recording tool to capture user interaction data with the analytical capabilities of LLMs, utilizing Nielsen’s usability heuristics as evaluation criteria. This methodology aims to significantly reduce the initial costs associated with UX testing while maintaining assessment quality. To validate the tool’s efficacy, we conducted a case study featuring a tennis-themed course reservation system. The system incorporated multiple scenarios per page, allowing users to perform tasks based on predefined goals. We employed our automated UX testing tool to evaluate screenshots and interaction logs from user sessions. Concurrently, we invited participants to test the system and complete UX questionnaires based on their experiences. Comparative analysis revealed that varying prompts in the automated UX testing tool yielded different outcomes, particularly in detecting interface elements. Notably, our tool demonstrated superior capability in identifying issues aligned with Nielsen’s usability principles compared to participant evaluations. This research contributes to the field of UX evaluation by leveraging advanced language models and established usability heuristics. Our findings suggest that LLM-based automated UX testing tools can offer more consistent and comprehensive assessments. © 2024 by the authors.

Such data inconsistency bugs can bring confusion to the users and deteriorate user experiences. They are a major target of industrial testing practice. However, due to the complication and diversity of GUI implementation and data presentation (e.g., the ways to present the data in natural language), detecting data inconsistency bugs is a very challenging task. It still largely relies on manual efforts. To reduce such human efforts, we proposed AutoConsis, an automated data inconsistency testing tool we designed for Meituan. one of the largest E-commerce providers with over 600 million transacting users. AutoConsis can automatically analyze GUI pages via a multi-modal deep-learning model and extract target data from textual phrases leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models). With these extracted data, their inconsistencies can then be detected. We evaluate the design of AutoConsis via a set of ablation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoConsis when applying it to real-world commercial mobile apps with eight representative cases. Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In the business automation world, APIs are everywhere. They provide access to enterprise tools such as customer relationship management solutions, or custom automations such as unattended RPA bots that automate repetitive tasks. Unfortunately, they may not be accessible to the business users who need them but are not equipped with the necessary technical skills to leverage them. Most recently, chatbots are becoming the go-to medium to make automation software accessible to business users. Since API specifications aren’t written with a chatbot use in mind, additional work is needed to make APIs accessible through a natural language interface. Making this process scalable to many APIs requires an automated data training pipeline for intent recognition models, a crucial component within chatbots to understand natural language utterances from users. More accurate intent recognition models lead to better user experience and satisfaction. Prior work proposed approaches to extracting intents from OpenAPI specifications. However, the resulting models tend to be brittle due to weaknesses in training data. In this work, we propose a data augmentation approach based on paraphrasing using large language models and propose a system to generate sentences to train intent recognition models. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our system is deployed in a real world setting. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Due to the emergence of natural language processing (NLP) interfaces, there has been growing intent to use conversational channels for commerce. Beyond customer service, NLP-enabled AI agents are being integrated into various steps of the order-to-cash (OTC) process. Social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger have become pivotal for businesses, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but adoption has been limited. In addition, attitudes towards fully-automated conversational agents (CA) have been mixed, and there is room for human involvement in transactional conversations. A distinguishing contribution of this research is leveraging the inherent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling multilingual conversations and extracting transactional details through named entity recognition (NER). The study describes a hybrid human-AI setup augmenting agents with an auto-agent leveraging LLMs’ natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, designed using the OTC process pattern applied to conversational UX frameworks. A prototype of the setup aims to streamline operations and reduce errors by enhancing the user experience during key OTC steps through improved conversational design. Recognizing the irreplaceable essence of human interaction, the hybrid human-in-the-loop approach was chosen, mitigating the impersonal nature of full automation. A prototype handling customers and humans augmented by LLMs for NER handling of transaction, customer, and product information was built. Sample synthetic bilingual conversations between customers and sales agents were generated using ChatGPT and fed into the system for evaluation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Bidders often take a long time to read and understand tender documents because they require specialized knowledge, and tender documents are generally long. Bidders first overview the specific items, such as payment and warranty, in a tender document and then check the overall document. Therefore, the function that can extract specific items (i.e., item extractor) and the function that can highlight words or phrases related to specific items (i.e., word-phrase highlighter) are in great demand. To develop the above two types of functions, we need to solve two problems. The first problem is the problem related to the annotated data set. The second problem concerns the BERT NER-based prediction approach in a small training dataset setting. To solve the first problem, we created two types of sequence labeling datasets related to Item Extractor and Word-Phrase Highlighter. To solve the second problem, we propose the Information Extraction (IE) method, which combines (1) a supervised learning approach using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and (2) a large language model (LLM)-based improver. We then developed the web application system called Tender Document Analyzer (TDDA), which includes "Item Extractor" and "Word-Phrase Highlighter". Experimental evaluation shows that our approach is practical. Firstly, the evaluation for extraction ability shows that the performance of our proposed method is much higher than the baseline approach that uses GPT 3.5, as well as demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based improver can improve the IE ability. In addition, the usability evaluation shows that bidders can solve the task in less time using our system. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Large-scale cloud systems play a pivotal role in modern IT infrastructure. However, incidents occurring within these systems can lead to service disruptions and adversely affect user experience. To swiftly resolve such incidents, on-call engineers depend on crafting domain-specific language (DSL) queries to analyze telemetry data. However, writing these queries can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper presents a thorough empirical study on the utilization of queries of KQL, a DSL employed for incident management in a large-scale cloud management system at MICROSOFT. The findings obtained underscore the importance and viability of KQL queries recommendation to enhance incident management. Building upon these valuable insights, we introduce XPERT, an end-to-end machine learning framework that automates KQL recommendation process. By leveraging historical incident data and large language models, XPERT generates customized KQL queries tailored to new incidents. Furthermore, XPERT incorporates a novel performance metric called XCORE, enabling a thorough evaluation of query quality from three comprehensive perspectives. We conduct extensive evaluations of XPERT, demonstrating its effectiveness in offline settings. Notably, we deploy XPERT in the real production environment of a large-scale incident management system in MICROSOFT, validating its efficiency in supporting incident management. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first empirical study of its kind, and XPERT stands as a pioneering DSL query recommendation framework designed for incident management. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Ensuring large language models' (LLMs) responses align with prompt instructions is crucial for application development. Based on our formative study with industry professionals, the alignment requires heavy human involvement and tedious trial-and-error especially when there are many instructions in the prompt. To address these challenges, we introduce CoPrompter, a framework that identifies misalignment based on assessing multiple LLM responses with criteria. It proposes a method to generate evaluation criteria questions derived directly from prompt requirements and an interface to turn these questions into a user-editable checklist. Our user study with industry prompt engineers shows that CoPrompter improves the ability to identify and refine instruction alignment with prompt requirements over traditional methods, helps them understand where and how frequently models fail to follow user's prompt requirements, and helps in clarifying their own requirements, giving them greater control over the response evaluation process. We also present the design lessons to underscore our system's potential to streamline the prompt engineering process. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The current college library system is hindered by inefficiencies in book searching, availability updates, identity verification, and checkout processes, resulting in delays and errors that negatively impact student experiences. This research paper presents an Al-based librarian system designed to address these challenges through automation and digital transformation. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), the proposed system facilitates personalized interactions between students and library resources. Upon student verification, the AI librarian provides real-time information on book availability, location, and tailored recommendations, significantly reducing the time spent on manual searches. The streamlined checkout process allows for automated book issuance and instant confirmation notifications, minimizing human error and enhancing record- keeping. This innovative solution not only improves operational efficiency but also enriches the user experience by offering a user-friendly interface and timely assistance. Future enhancements, such as voice integration and mobile application support, are suggested to further modernize library services. This research underscores the potential of AI technologies to revolutionize library management and improve service delivery in academic settings. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - As software systems expand in complexity, managing the vast and varied collection of test cases becomes increasingly difficult with traditional manual testing methods. This paper presents a new approach for automating the generation of structured test cases, named Test Element Extraction and Restructuring (TEER), which leverages the advanced natural language processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically targeting human-computer interaction (HCI) software, TEER employs prompt tuning techniques to extract critical elements from natural language test cases and systematically reassemble them into structured formats. The study evaluates the effectiveness of TEER by applying it to common test cases from desktop HCI applications. The experimental results demonstrate that this method successfully produces structured test cases that meet predefined requirements. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Citizen science (CS) projects, which engage the general public in scientific research, often face challenges in ensuring high-quality data collection and maintaining user engagement. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution by providing automated, real-time assistance to users, reducing the need for extensive human intervention, and offering instant support. The CS project Les Herbonautes, dedicated to mass digitization of the French National Herbarium, serves as a case study for this paper, which details the development and evaluation of a network of open source LLM agents to assist users during data collection. The research involved the review of related work, stakeholder meetings with the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, and user and context analyses to formalize system requirements. With these, a prototype with a user interface in the form of a chatbot was designed and implemented using LangGraph, and afterward evaluated through expert evaluation to assess its effect on usability and user experience (UX). The findings indicate that such a chatbot can enhance UX and improve data quality by guiding users and providing immediate feedback. However, limitations due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs exist, suggesting that workflows must be carefully designed to mitigate potential errors and ensure reliable performance. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Large Language Model (LLM)-based in-application assistants, or copilots, can automate software tasks, but users often prefer learning by doing, raising questions about the optimal level of automation for an effective user experience. We investigated two automation paradigms by designing and implementing a fully automated copilot (AutoCopilot) and a semi-automated copilot (GuidedCopilot) that automates trivial steps while offering step-by-step visual guidance. In a user study (N=20) across data analysis and visual design tasks, GuidedCopilot outperformed AutoCopilot in user control, software utility, and learnability, especially for exploratory and creative tasks, while AutoCopilot saved time for simpler visual tasks. A follow-up design exploration (N=10) enhanced GuidedCopilot with task-and state-aware features, including in-context preview clips and adaptive instructions. Our findings highlight the critical role of user control and tailored guidance in designing the next generation of copilots that enhance productivity, support diverse skill levels, and foster deeper software engagement. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The paper explores the opportunities and challenges for metaverse learning environments with AI-Assistants based on Large Language Models. A proof of concept based on popular but proprietary technologies is presented that enables a natural language exchange between the user and an AI-based medical expert in a highly immersive environment based on the Unreal Engine. The answers generated by ChatGPT are not only played back lip-synchronously, but also visualized in the VR environment using a 3D model of a skeleton. Usability and user experience play a particularly important role in the development of the highly immersive AI-Assistant. The proof of concept serves to illustrate the opportunities and challenges that lie in the merging of large language models, metaverse applications and educational ecosystems, which are self-contained research areas. Development strategies, tools and interoperability standards will be presented to facilitate future developments in this triangle of tension. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are at the heart of almost every software we encounter. GUIs are often created through a collaborative effort involving UX designers, product owners, and software developers, constantly facing changing requirements. Historically, problems in GUI development include a fragmented, poorly integrated tool landscape and high synchronization efforts between stakeholders. Recent approaches suggest using large language models (LLMs) to recognize requirements fulfillment in GUIs and automatically propose new GUI components. Based on ten interviews with practitioners, this paper proposes an LLM-based assistant as a Figma plug-in that bridges the gap between user stories and GUI prototyping. We evaluated the prototype with 40 users and 40 crowd-workers, showing that the effectiveness of GUI creation is improved by using LLMs to detect requirements' completion and generate new GUI components. We derive design rationales to support cross-functional integration in software development, ensuring that our plug-in integrates well into established processes. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Educating the next generation of students on pathways toward sustainability is important and highly relevant for various disciplines, including HCI and CSCW. HCI research has contributed much to the field of sustainability, though mainly taking user-centric and environmental perspectives, missing a holistic view of sustainability. By incorporating sustainability goals into design and development processes, students can learn that they can have a significant impact and improve the longevity and durability of digital tools. This workshop will present and explore the SusAF framework as a tool for the sustainability analysis of digital tools in university courses. SusAF is an established framework that enables exploring the different dimensions of sustainability. In this workshop, we will apply this framework to AI-based tools, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. The goal is to present SusAF as a framework for sustainability analysis of software systems used in higher education and to explore, with the participants, the different sustainability challenges of using AI-based tools. In this full-day workshop, we want to engage an interdisciplinary group of researchers, lecturers, and practitioners in sustainability analysis and we will explore the relevance of SusAF in various educational settings. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In a changing and connected world, people are surrounded by an increasing number of smart devices in a complex system. Intelligent technology has revolutionised the way we interact with these devices, and has resulted in improved user experiences through the integration of physical status and digital applications. However, this transition has also presented new challenges and demands for transdisciplinary adaptation in traditional approaches to design education. Many existing design methods and frameworks have not kept pace with the level of automation now seen in intelligent interactive products, nor have they addressed human-machine interdependence in a system-thinking context. The aim of this study is to gain insights from the younger generation of design students to inform the development of a more suitable design course. Using smart home products as the case scenario, 39 industrial design students evaluated the user experience with the products through hands-on interaction. The individual product reviews of the robot cleaner, smart speaker and smart lightbulb were then analysed and consolidated. Thus, this study contributes to the elucidation of design students' perspectives on intelligent user interfaces. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of user insights was conducted through peer assessments, focus groups and large language models to explore their potential and difference in terms of the design process. Overall, the goal of this analysis is to advance the field of design practice and education. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In design research there is a deep interest in how designers solve complex problems using design methods and heuristic shortcuts and in particular how this might relate to Machine Language (ML) to simulate the design process. With the introduction of Large Language Model (LLMs) such as Chat GPT we can appreciate how software with the remarkable capability of Generative AI (Gen AI) and generative design can be used to assist designers in the three-dimensional design of their products. In this paper, we will focus on how AI will impact designing in computing, identify what is relevant and suggest a new development opportunity. Our interest is in examining the potential for better and novel software solutions, making them easier to use during the design synthesis process and capable of adjustment throughout the 3D CAD development stage. The specific problem we aim to resolve is how to optimise a designer's time spent from concept to production using Gen AI & 3D CAD software without affecting the quality of design thinking, methodology and practical process. Gen AI as an evolving platform has the potential to create a design to production productivity shift that industry and academic groups have long predicted. Designing will remain creative and inventive, individualistic or team based and using what we have termed an AI design assistant, AIDA. © 2024 Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Rise of the Machines: Design Education in the Generative AI Era, E and PDE 2024.

AB  - This study explores how AI-enabled work tools influence the Flow experiences of IT professionals, focusing on their potential to enhance or hinder states of deep focus and immersion. Drawing on interviews with 12 IT professionals, the research examines the interplay between AI tools, task characteristics, and Flow preconditions such as goal clarity, feedback, and the challenge-skill balance. The study follows ethical research design recommendations, ensuring participant privacy and informed consent. Findings reveal that AI tools generally play a supportive role, aiding productivity and creativity without consistently inducing Flow states. Their impact depends heavily on task complexity and user goals, with tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT enhancing Flow-related conditions such as feedback and exploratory possibilities. However, limitations such as inaccuracies and poor adaptability to complex tasks occasionally disrupt Flow experiences. The study offers design recommendations to better align AI tools with Flow principles, including enhancing goal clarity, dynamic adaptability, and support for iterative exploration. These insights contribute to the growing discourse on AI’s role in fostering psychological engagement and optimal experiences in professional settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Personality assessments provide insights into understanding individual differences. In HCI, personality assessments are used to model user behavior or tailor user interfaces. However, conventional Likert-scale personality tests face issues in user engagement and capturing comprehensive personality nuances. Building upon prior work using conversational user interfaces for personality prediction, we delve deeper into personalized personality tests. Through a formative study (n=4), we identified three design goals for user engagement. Informed by these goals, we propose a novel architecture integrating multiple large language model agents to support free-form conversation-based personality assessment. Our system, ChatFive, predicts users' Big Five traits through real-Time personalized dialogue. Evaluations from our user study (n=20) revealed that ChatFive significantly improved conveying true responses and felt more engaged, though requiring longer response times and different validation. We discuss the limitations on the validity of ChatFive and its implications. © 2024 Owner/Author.

JA  - Proc. ACM Hum. Comput. Interact.
AB  - Software engineers have historically relied on human-powered Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) as coding aids. With the rise of generative AI, developers have started to adopt AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in their software development process. Recognizing the potential parallels between human-powered Q&A platforms and AI-powered question-based chatbots, we investigate and compare how developers integrate this assistance into their real-world coding experiences by conducting a thematic analysis of 1700+ Reddit posts. Through a comparative study of SO and ChatGPT, we identified each platform's strengths, use cases, and barriers. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT offers fast, clear, comprehensive responses and fosters a more respectful environment than SO. However, concerns about ChatGPT's reliability stem from its overly confident tone and the absence of validation mechanisms like SO's voting system. Based on these findings, we synthesized the design implications for future GenAI code assistants and recommend a workflow leveraging each platform's unique features to improve developer experiences. © 2025 Owner/Author.

AB  - This paper highlights the trip-easiness generative AI mechanism to simplify domestic and international travel planning through a comprehensive services range based on the users’ locations, including itinerary management and car rental. This research focuses on building TripEase GenAI Mechanism with generative artificial intelligence (AI) for a fully-fledged AI-based trip planner web application. This mechanism would function independently in addition to the alternative of seamless integration with another platform, a car rental and travel planning system. This would enhance the overall user experience. Within our TripEase GenAI mechanism, users can effortlessly create personalized recommended itineraries after providing their essential trip details. This mechanism will generate a complete itinerary. The suggested itinerary would accompany a tailored packing list specific to the destination. We are leveraging cutting-edge tools such as LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and ChatGPT to achieve this objective. Our main aim is to revolutionize the travel planning experience by harnessing the power of AI technology. This research is envisioned to provide travelers with a seamless and personalized journey that caters to their individual preferences and needs. This paper outlines the design, evolution, and planning of the TripEase GenAI mechanism. We have laid a strong foundation for a user-friendly travel planning platform through meticulous documentation, thoughtful design, and iterative development. The ultimate goal is to enhance the overall travel planning experience by efficiently enriching imported services such as itinerary management and car rental modules. © (2024), (Insight Society).

AB  - A frequent use of conversational user interfaces (CUIs) today is improving the users’ experience with online quantitative surveys. In this paper, we explore the use of CUIs in qualitative surveys. As a concrete use case, we adopt a specific, well-structured, qualitative research method called the repertory grid technique (RGT). We developed a hybrid user interface (HUI) that combines a graphical user interface (GUI) with a CUI to automate the distinct stages in a RGT survey. A pilot study was used to verify the feasibility of the approach and to fine-tune interface aspects of an initial prototype. In this paper, we report the results of a within-subject lab experiment with 24 participants that aimed to establish the performance and UX in a realistic context of a more advanced prototype. We observed a small decrease in UX in some hedonistic aspects, but also confirmed that the HUI performs similarly to a human agent in most pragmatic aspects. These results provide support for our hypothesis that automating qualitative surveys is possible with proper interface design. We hope that our work can inspire other researchers to design additional tools for qualitative survey automation, especially now that generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, open up interesting new ways for computer systems to interact with users in natural language. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Design systems have become an industry standard for creating consistent, usable, and effective digital interfaces. However, detecting and correcting violations of design system guidelines, known as UI linting, is a major challenge. Manual UI linting is time-consuming and tedious, making it a prime candidate for automation. This paper presents a case study of adopting AI for UI linting. Through collaborative prototyping with UX designers, we analyzed the limitations of existing AI models and identified designers' core needs and priorities in UI linting. With such knowledge, we designed a hybrid technical pipeline that combines the deterministic nature of heuristics with the flexibility of large language models. Our case study demonstrates that AI alone is not sufficient for practical adoption and highlights the importance of a deep understanding of AI capabilities and user-centered design approaches. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Memory augmentation has long been a central field in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Recently, emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended research on memory augmentation by enabling the retrieval of information stored in multiple formats (e.g., text and image) through free-form queries. However, literature has focused on text-based memory aids, there has been surprisingly limited research on image-based assistance, despite humans' superior efficiency in processing visual information. Therefore, in this work, we explore the effect of image aids on memory augmentation. To this end, we first design and implement an augmented reality (AR) memory augmentation system, informed by human evaluation of MLLM performance (GPT-4o, LLaVA, and Mini-Gemini) and insights from user interface (UI) design workshops. As a result, we found that GPT-4o is most suitable for our system, images complemented with text (i.e., Image+text) are the most preferred format of memory aids. We also identified optimal UI design parameters for AR-based memory augmentation. With a finalized version of the system prototype, we conduct a user study (N=20) consisting of two tasks that simulate real-life memory-related challenges. We found that Image+text significantly enhanced both recall performance and memory vividness. Additionally, from a user experience perspective, Image+text was considered the most helpful and easiest to use for memory augmentation. Our findings showed that images are a powerful modality for enhancing memory recall, extending beyond traditional text-based approaches. We expect that insights gained from this work will contribute to the development of practical, everyday memory augmentation systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The last 3 years have witnessed an increasing awareness and consensus on using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance decision-making in the construction sector. This study explores the integration of ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) into traditional risk management frameworks within the construction industry, contributing to the ongoing discourse on AI's role in enhancing risk identification, analysis, and mitigation. Using a mixed-method approach comparing ChatGPT-assisted to human evaluations, interviews, and a case study, the research develops a better understanding of construction risk analysis processes and discusses decision-making errors of omission, over- and underestimation of probabilities and impacts, and treatment of the residual risk after proposed mitigation strategies. Results suggest that users' experience of ChatGPT is primarily favorable, characterized by quick responses and an intuitive interface that enhances decision-making efficiency. Findings indicate that GPT may be especially beneficial for less experienced practitioners since it provides comprehensive risk awareness. However, experienced professionals contend that the software lacks contextual depth. The study contributes a ChatGPT-4 prompt to evaluate infrastructure risk for a given project scope. An evidenced case study on a road upgrade project in Ireland demonstrates a lessened dependence on the quality of user prompting skills and emphasizes the quality of project scope data input. A collaborative approach, including Chat-GPT early involvement and human refinement, promises to enhance conventional risk management speed and efficiency and reduce bias and inflexibility while maintaining the adaptability and ethical rigour required in the industry's evolving risk landscape. © 2025 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been explored for a variety of tasks, most prominently for dialogue-based interactions with users. The future in-car voice assistant (VA) is envisioned as a proactive companion making suggestions to the user during the ride. We investigate the use of selected LLMs to generate proactive suggestions for a VA given different context situations by using a basic prompt design. An online study with users was conducted to evaluate the generated suggestions. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating context-based proactive suggestions with different off-the-shelf LLMs. Results of the user survey show that suggestions generated by the LLMs GPT4.0 and Bison received an overall positive evaluation regarding the user experience for response quality and response behavior over different context situations. This work can serve as a starting point to implement proactive interaction for VA with LLMs based on the recognized context situation in the car. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs) has presented the opportunity for novice programmers to make use of them for the purpose of understanding and synthesising code. In this paper, we discuss a small pilot study intended to explore the user experience of doing so in a limited way, and the attitudes of a group of novice programmers towards this style of programming. We also draw parallels to the seminal work of Lisanne Bainbridge, and discuss the way in which her "ironies of automation" are also present when attempting to automate the activity of programming. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - While conversational agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can drive progress in many domains, they are prone to generating faulty information. To ensure an efficient, safe, and satisfactory user experience maximizing benefits of these systems, users must be empowered to judge the reliability of system outputs. In this, both disclaimers and agents' communicative style are pivotal design instances. In an online study with 594 participants, we investigated how these affect users' trust and a mock-up agent's persuasiveness, based on an established framework from social psychology. While prior information on potential inaccuracies or faulty information did not affect trust, an authoritative communicative style elicited more trust. Also, a trusted agent was more persuasive resulting in more positive attitudes regarding the subject of the conversation. Results imply that disclaimers on agents' limitations fail to effectively alter users' trust but can be supported by appropriate communicative style during interaction. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - With the rapid advance of machine learning (ML) technology, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as an intelligent tool to generate program code from natural language specifications. However, existing evaluations of LLMs have focused on their capabilities in comparison with humans. It is desirable to evaluate their usability when deciding on whether to use a LLM in software production. This paper proposes a user centric method for this purpose. It includes metadata in the test cases of a benchmark to describe their usages, conducts testing in a multi-attempt process that mimics the uses of LLMs, measures LLM generated solutions on a set of quality attributes that reflect usability, and evaluates the performance based on user experiences in the uses of LLMs as a tool. The paper also reports a case study with the method in the evaluation of ChatGPT's usability as a code generation tool for the R programming language. Our experiments demonstrated that ChatGPT is highly useful for generating R program code although it may fail on hard programming tasks. The user experiences are good with overall average number of attempts being 1.61 and the average time of completion being 47.02 seconds. Our experiments also found that the weakest aspect of usability is conciseness, which has a score of 3.80 out of 5. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The advancement of computer-based innovations over the years has drastically altered the role of the end-user, from passive users of technology to active participants influencing technological development. Each major innovation, associated with preceding hardware and software milestones, has led to new understandings and skill sets required of end-users. This workshop position paper explores the technological progress from mainframe computers to personal computers, the internet, and the nascent age of artificial intelligence (AI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We examine how each technological leap has transformed the end-user experience, the evolving literacies demanded, and speculate how the evolution of user interaction with technology in the future might move in different directions and widen the technological gap. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for creating personalized knowledge experiences for users, often serving as their own interface through text-based chatbots. The interpretation of user intent and generation of output occur implicitly within the model's architecture. We propose an alternative approach in a system we call Bespoke where the LLM acts as an agent to explicitly reason about user intent, plan, and generate graphical interfaces to fulfill that intent. This approach enables the creation of visually rich interactions that complement chat-based interactions. By employing a step-by-step reasoning process to reduce ambiguity and keep the model on track, we compose interfaces from a toolkit of widgets, providing a designed and tailored user experience. Our early experiment shows that the output interface differs depending on the interpreted intent. In the current version, these interactions are multimodal in the automatic generation of UI; in future versions, this paradigm can be extended to multiple modalities of input and output. This agentive approach moves the interface towards a personalized, bespoke experience with multimodal interaction that adapts to the user's intentions.

AB  - This study addresses the need for comprehensive feedback in academic physiotherapy programs. Existing methods often fall short of providing coherent feedback using keywords, leaving a gap in evaluating crucial clinical skills. Introducing iAtexF, a Keyword-Based AI system, it offers instant feedback during practical exams, categorized into 'Good', 'Improvement', and 'Read more', aiding students in understanding their performance. Utilizing a Seq2seq framework with diverse LSTM and attention mechanisms, iAtexF excels in relevance, achieving a high similarity score of 73% and a ROUGE score of 34%. It surpasses both ChatGPT and experts in providing relevant suggestions (80.7%), maintaining an appropriate tone (86.7%), and ensuring a logical structure order (100%). User experience evaluation of the iAtexF web application yielded a favourable 92% rating, indicating its usability and effectiveness. This research signifies a significant advancement in educational technology and natural language processing, enhancing physiotherapy training through personalized AI-generated feedback, thereby improving the overall learning experience. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper explores how Large-Language Model Artificial Intelligences (LLM-AIs) can be used to support people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and other learning differences which effect cognition and self-regulation. It examines the cognitive load associated with complex writing tasks and how it affects users who have trouble with high-order thinking and planning. OpenAI’s GPT-3 API is used to analyze how AI can help with complex language-based tasks. The paper first reflects on how GPT-3 uses natural language processing to generate text, translate, summarize, answer questions, and caption images, as well as how it adapts to respond to different situations and tasks to accurately classify them. Bloom’s Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy are highlighted as language-driven methods of assessing learner understanding and to design activities and assessments that encourage high-order thinking. Literature is reviewed which suggests that students with disorders which effect executive functions need extra help with their writing skills to do well in school, and that early and accessible interventions such as digital self-management tools already help these learners. A model of executive-cognitive capacity is proposed to assess how best to manage the cognition of tasks and workloads, and to support a design matrix for assistive tools and processes. Finally, the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) model for writing is evaluated for use as a procedural high-order writing process by which the tools can be designed and against which their efficacy can be validated. This review illustrates a universal design method for the development and evaluation of future AI writing tools for all users, with specific consideration towards users with atypical cognitive and sensory processing needs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Smart cities are complex urban environments that rely on advanced technology and data analytics to enhance city services’ quality of life, sustainability, and efficiency. As these cities continue to evolve, there is a growing need for a structured framework to evaluate and integrate products that align with smart city objectives. This paper introduces the Pentagon Framework, a comprehensive evaluation method designed to ensure that products and their materials meet the specific needs of smart cities. The framework focuses on five key features–smart, sustainable, sensing, social, and safe–collectively called the Penta-S concept. These features provide a structured approach to categorizing and assessing products, ensuring alignment with the city’s goals for efficiency, sustainability, and user experience. The Smart City Pentagon Framework Analyzer is also presented, a dedicated web application that facilitates interaction with the framework. It allows product data input, provides feedback on alignment with the Penta-S features, and suggests personality traits based on the OCEAN model. Complementing the web application, the Smart City Penta-S Compliance Assistant API, developed through ChatGPT, offers a more profound, personalized evaluation of products, including the life cycle phase recommendations using the IPPMD model. This paper contributes to the development of smart city solutions by providing a flexible framework that can be applied to any product type, optimizing its life cycle, and ensuring compliance with the Pentagon Framework. This approach improves product integration and fosters user satisfaction by tailoring products and their materials to meet specific user preferences and needs within the smart city environment. The proposed framework emphasizes citizen-centric design and highlights its advantages over conventional evaluation methods, ultimately enhancing urban planning and smart city development. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic restrictions limited all social activities to curtail the spread of the virus. The foremost and most prime sector among those affected were schools, colleges, and universities. The education system of entire nations had shifted to online education during this time. Many shortcomings of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) were detected to support education in an online mode that spawned the research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools that are being developed by the research community to improve the effectiveness of LMSs. This paper presents a detailed survey of the different enhancements to LMSs, which are led by key advances in the area of AI to enhance the real-time and non-real-time user experience. The AI-based enhancements proposed to the LMSs start from the Application layer and Presentation layer in the form of flipped classroom models for the efficient learning environment and appropriately designed UI/UX for efficient utilization of LMS utilities and resources, including AI-based chatbots. Session layer enhancements are also required, such as AI-based online proctoring and user authentication using Biometrics. These extend to the Transport layer to support real-time and rate adaptive encrypted video transmission for user security/privacy and satisfactory working of AI-algorithms. It also needs the support of the Networking layer for IP-based geolocation features, the Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature, and the support of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for optimum Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, in addition to these, non-real-time user experience is enhanced by other AI-based enhancements such as Plagiarism detection algorithms and Data Analytics. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

AB  - Kampung Batik Laweyan, a historic neighborhood in Surakarta, Indonesia, is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and tradition of batik textile production. With a history spanning several centuries, this area has become a vibrant hub for batik artisans and enthusiasts, showcasing intricate designs and craftsmanship that reflect local identity. The development of a mobile UI/UX application aimed at enhancing tourism in Kampung Batik Laweyan employs a Multi-User Centered Design (MUCD) methodology. The project unfolds in two iterations, beginning with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) followed by the collection of feedback from primary user groups, including local business operators, residents, and tourists. Data collection involves interviews with local authorities, observations of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) environment in Laweyan, and an evaluation of current tourism marketing strategies. This comprehensive approach ensures that the application effectively caters to the diverse needs of its users. By integrating location-based gamification and a Large Language Model (LLM), the application not only enhances user engagement but also promotes the cultural and economic potential of the region. The System Usability Scale (SUS) assessment reveals an average score of 72.5, indicating a "good"level of usability, with qualitative feedback affirming its intuitive design and potential for further mobile app development. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Modern software systems demand continuous evolution to maintain performance, scalability, and security. Traditional single-agent AI-driven code refactoring approaches are often limited in addressing the multi-faceted constraints (e.g., performance, security, maintainability) that emerge during complex software design tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Large Language Model (LLM) Environment for automated software design and refactoring. Our conceptual framework comprises specialized LLM 'experts,' each trained or fine-tuned on a different aspect of software engineering (performance optimization, security hardening, UI/UX, maintainability). These agents collaborate in a cooperative or competitive fashion-using coordination protocols akin to consensus or auction mechanisms-to synthesize design insights and refactoring recommendations. We present formal definitions of agent interactions (including mathematical notation for termination conditions), a sequence diagram demonstrating agent collaboration, a complexity analysis of the coordination mechanism, and an expanded reference list. Preliminary experimental design is outlined to demonstrate how multi-agent interactions may resolve conflicting design goals more effectively than a single-agent approach. Our aim is to provide a roadmap for integrating multi-agent LLMs into the software development lifecycle, thereby improving development efficiency, reducing technical debt, and enhancing software quality. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) enable state-of-the-art semantic capabilities to be added to software systems such as semantic search of unstructured documents and text generation. However, these models are computationally expensive. At scale, the cost of serving thousands of users increases massively affecting also user experience. To address this problem, semantic caches are used to check for answers to similar queries (that may have been phrased differently) without hitting the LLM service. Due to the nature of these semantic cache techniques that rely on query embeddings, there is a high chance of errors impacting user confidence in the system. Adopting semantic cache techniques usually requires testing the effectiveness of a semantic cache (accurate cache hits and misses) which requires a labelled test set of similar queries and responses which is often unavailable. In this paper, we present VaryGen, an approach for using LLMs for test input generation that produces similar questions from unstructured text documents. Our novel approach uses the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to 1) adapt queries to the domain, 2) synthesise subtle variations to queries, and 3) evaluate the synthesised test dataset. We evaluated our approach in the domain of a student question and answer system by qualitatively analysing 100 generated queries and result pairs, and conducting an empirical case study with an open source semantic cache. Our results show that query pairs satisfy human expectations of similarity and our generated data demonstrates failure cases of a semantic cache. Additionally, we also evaluate our approach on Qasper dataset. This work is an important first step into test input generation for semantic applications and presents considerations for practitioners when calibrating a semantic cache. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to enable agents to learn and perform tasks autonomously with superhuman performance. However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously. In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent’s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent’s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists. Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment. We highlight human involvement, explanation requirements, new challenges, and goals for each phase. We furthermore identify low-risk, high-return opportunities for explainability research in HITL RL and present long-term research goals to advance the field. Finally, we propose a vision of human-robot collaboration that allows both parties to reach their full potential and cooperate effectively. ©2024 The Authors.

AB  - The software industry is continuously evolving because of emerging technologies, evolving development methodologies, changing business needs, and shifting stakeholder preferences. Effectively managing daily changes is critical, especially given the complexity of requirement change management (RCM), which requires the development of adaptable systems that accurately reflect dynamic conditions. This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, into software engineering to enhance the effectiveness of RCM. This paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of LLM GPT-4 to analyze and predict the impacts of software requirement changes before implementation. Our approach combines LLMs with a structured analysis framework that interprets changes in software requirements and evaluates their potential impacts across multiple dimensions. The use of GPT-4 can revolutionize how software engineers understand and implement requirements changes, providing a comprehensive tool for predicting the impact of such changes and evaluating the consequences accurately. The results of this research can help requirements engineers perform automated change impact analysis, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the acceptance or rejection of requirement change requests. This ultimately supports the creation of software products that better align with consumer needs and expectations, ensuring enhanced user experiences and satisfaction. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Circuit design is one of the initial stages of any electronic & electrical projects. It has been a hard part of building a product since, it can be easily solved only by professional developers. In order to solve this part, a tool is build that combines both the core knowledge of electronics & artificial intelligence. AI circuit builder is a tool that can be used by people who are beginners and don't really have a particular knowledge in a specific part of the circuit. The user can easily prompt the LLM in the form of natural language. The tool then generates a digital format for the desired output. The output is processed with a routing algorithm in order to sort out the routes. With the help of various modern technologies for the web the tool provides a seamless user experience overall. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate and compare the subjective quality of an AI-based training system developed for conducting child interviews, focusing on the distinction between immersive 3D (using virtual reality) and 2D desktop environments. To this end, a structured user study was conducted, involving 36 participants who were exposed to these two distinct environments. The study evaluated various aspects of user experience, namely presence, usability, visual fidelity, emotion, responsiveness, appropriateness, and training effectiveness. The findings reveal significant differences in user experience between the 2D and 3D environments. Notably, the 3D environment enhanced presence, visual fidelity, training effectiveness, and empathy. In contrast, the 2D environment was favored for usability. The study highlights the potential of immersive VR while also pointing out the need to improve the system response and emotional expressiveness of the avatars. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for disseminating Cultural Heritage (CH), often incorporating Virtual Humans (VHs) to guide users through historical recreations. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) now enables natural, unscripted communication with these VHs, even on limited devices. This paper details a natural interaction system for VHs within a VR application of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our system integrates Speech-to-Text, LLM-based dialogue generation, and Text-to-Speech synthesis. Adhering to user-centered design (UCD) principles, we conducted two studies: a preliminary study revealing user interest in historically adapted language, and a qualitative test that identified key user experience improvements, such as incorporating feedback mechanisms and gender selection for VHs. The project successfully developed a prioritized user experience, focusing on usability evaluation, immersion, and dialogue quality. We propose a generalist methodology and recommendations for integrating unscripted VH dialogue in VR. However, limitations include dialogue generation latency and reduced quality in non-English languages. While a formative usability test evaluated the process, the small sample size restricts broad generalizations about user behavior. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have become central to modern software development, especially with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance programming efficiency and decision-making. The study of in-IDE Human-AI Experience is critical in understanding how these AI tools are transforming the software development process, impacting programmer productivity, and influencing code quality.We conducted a literature review to study the current state of in-IDE Human-AI Experience research, bridging a gap in understanding the nuanced interactions between programmers and AI assistants within IDEs. By analyzing 36 selected papers, our study illustrates three primary research branches: Design, Impact, and Quality of Interaction.The trends, challenges, and opportunities identified in this paper emphasize the evolving landscape of software development and inform future directions for research, and development in this dynamic field. Specifically, we invite the community to investigate three aspects of these interactions: designing task-specific user interface, building trust, and improving readability. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Communicating design implications is common within the HCI community when publishing academic papers, yet these papers are rarely read and used by designers. One solution is to use design cards as a form of translational resource that communicates valuable insights from papers in a more digestible and accessible format to assist in design processes. However, creating design cards can be time-consuming, and authors may lack the resources/know-how to produce cards. Through an iterative design process, we built a system that helps create design cards from academic papers using an LLM and text-to-image model. Our evaluation with designers (N = 21) and authors of selected papers (N = 12) revealed that designers perceived the design implications from our design cards as more inspiring and generative, compared to reading original paper texts, and the authors viewed our system as an efective way of communicating their design implications. We also propose future enhancements for AI-generated design cards. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - This doctoral thesis explores the integration of Generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models, in educational platforms. Emphasis is placed on cross-lingual transfer techniques to overcome language barriers and create personalized content. The study addresses the impact of Generative AI on personalized learning experiences and ethical concerns. A mixed-methods approach combines quantitative usage metrics with qualitative insights from interviews and surveys. Initial results indicate improved task performance and user engagement, but ongoing refinement is needed to address biases and ethics. The LATILL platform, a web search engine for German as Foreign Language teachers, is a case study. It leverages Generative AI to provide level-Appropriate texts, translations, and image generation. The research aims to determine this technology s impact and future potential on user experience, focusing on equitable access to personalized learning across diverse geolocations. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Mobile app users commonly rely on app store ratings and reviews to find apps that suit their needs. However, the sheer volume of reviews available on app stores can lead to information overload, thus impeding users’ ability to make informed app selection decisions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize mobile app reviews. In particular, we use the Chain of Density (CoD) prompt to guide OpenAI GPT-4 to generate abstractive, semantically dense, and readable summaries of mobile app reviews. The CoD prompt is engineered to iteratively extract salient entities from the source text and fuse them into a fixed-length summary. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a large dataset of mobile app reviews. We further conduct an empirical evaluation with 48 study participants to assess the readability of the generated CoD summaries. Our results show that an altered CoD prompt can correctly identify the main themes in user reviews and consolidate them into a natural language summary that is intended for end-user consumption. The prompt also manages to maintain the readability of the generated summaries while increasing their density. Our work in this paper aims to substantially improve mobile app users’ experience by providing an effective mechanism for summarizing important user feedback in the review stream. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - In all kinds of organizations, relational data is prevalent and ubiquitous in a plethora of systems. However, the integration and exchange of such data is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. Semantic technologies, such as ontologies, KGs, and linked data, were developed to facilitate this but require comprehensive technical skills and complex methods for mapping relational data to semantic formalisms. Naturally, this process lacks speed, scalability, and automation. This work presents a novel user-driven neuro-symbolic approach to transform relational data into KGs. In our approach, users are supported by neural models (in particular Large Language Models) and symbolic formalisms (ontologies and mappings) to automate various mapping tasks and thus speed up and scale up the transformation from relational to linked data. We implemented our approach in a comprehensive intelligent assistant dubbed LXS. Our experimental evaluation, conducted primarily with participants from the Robert Bosch GmbH, demonstrates enhanced mapping quality compared to manual creation, a competitive application, and AI-only generations. Additionally, it significantly reduces user interaction time by nearly half, independent of the user’s experience level. Also, qualitatively, users appreciated the attractiveness and novelty of the user interface. Furthermore, the neuro-symbolic approach of LXS contributes to a more trustworthy human-AI interaction since it keeps users in the loop and provides transparency in the transformation process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - In this paper, developing an online tool for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of unconventional construction materials in collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs) is proposed. The LCA provides information on the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to disposal or recycling. The LLMs are neural network architectures, typically utilizing variants of recurrent neural networks such as the transformer, which are trained on large bodies of textual data using techniques such as pre-training and fine-tuning. This study focuses on the use of bacterial cellulose composites as a biobased unconventional construction material. The methodology of developing an LLM-aided LCA tool is divided into five stages: Defining the functional unit; identifying the life cycle stages; collecting environmental and social impact data; interpreting and evaluating; developing a web-based tool. The results of this study have shown that the designers can incorporate sustainable thinking in the design process by using LLMs integrated to LCA, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future against the impacts of the Anthropocene. Overall, the outcomes demonstrated the value of human-computer interaction (HCI) as a tool for exploring new possibilities with biobased materials and for inspiring designers to reconsider the material evaluation in their work. Future studies can delve into the integration of this tool into building information modeling software or computational design software in order to perform LCA for 3D structures. Different scales of such applications in design practices, such as fashion design, product design or service design can also be conducted by questioning how LCA can be combined with LLMs to leverage novel sustainable design solutions. © 2023, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

AB  - With the rapid development of web technology, more and more software applications have become web-based in the past decades. To ensure software quality and user experience, various techniques have been proposed to automatically test web applications by interacting with their GUIs. To achieve high functional coverage, web GUI testing tools often need to generate high-quality text inputs and interact with the associated GUI elements (e.g., click submit buttons). However, developing a holistic approach that solves both subtasks is challenging because the web GUI context can be complicated and highly dynamic, which is hard to process programmatically. The recent development of large vision-language models (LVLM) provides new opportunities to handle these longstanding problems. We in this paper propose VETL, the first LVLM-driven end-to-end web testing technique. With LVLM's scene understanding capabilities, VETL can generate valid and meaningful text inputs focusing on the local context, while avoiding the need to extract precise textual attributes. The selection of associated GUI elements is formulated as a visual question answering problem, allowing LVLM to capture the logical connection between the input box and the relevant element based on visual instructions. Further, the GUI exploration is guided by a multi-armed bandit module employing a curiosity-oriented strategy. Experiments show that VETL is effective in exploring web state/action spaces and detecting bugs. Compared with WebExplor, the state-of-the-art web testing technique, VETL can discover 25% more unique web actions on benchmark websites. Moreover, it can expose functional bugs in top-ranking commercial websites, which have been confirmed by the website maintainers. Our work makes the first attempt of leveraging LVLM in end-to-end GUI testing, demonstrating promising results of this research direction. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - UI animations, such as card movement and menu slide in/out, provide appealing user experience and enhance the usability of mobile applications. In the process of UI animation implementation, it is difficult for developers to identify suitable APIs for the animation to be implemented from a large number of APIs. Fortunately, the huge app market contains millions of apps, and they can provide valuable data resources for solving this problem. By summarizing the API usage for the same or similar animations in apps, reusable knowledge can be mined for the API recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel method Animation2API, which mines the knowledge about APIs from existing apps and recommends APIs for UI animations. Different from existing text-based API recommendation approaches, Animation2API takes the UI animation in GIF/video format as query input. Firstly, we construct a database containing mappings between UI animations and APIs by analyzing a broad set of apps. Then, we build a UI animation feature extractor, which can be used to gain temporal-spatial feature vectors of UI animations. By comparing the temporal-spatial feature vectors between UI animations, we identify animations that are similar to the query animation from the database. Finally, we summarize the APIs used for implementing these animations and recommend a list of APIs for developers. The empirical evaluation results show that our method can achieve 82.66% Success rate and outperform the baseline Guru by 230.77% and 184.95% in terms of Precision and Recall when considering twenty APIs. In the user study, we take the scenarios of using web search and ChatGPT to implement animations as baselines, and the results show that participants can complete animations faster (14.54%) after using Animation2API. Furthermore, participants' positive feedbacks on the questionnaire indicate the usefulness of Animation2API. © 1976-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Within the mHealth framework, systematic research that collects and analyzes patient data to establish comprehensive digital health archives for hypertensive patients, and leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in health management and Blood Pressure (BP) control remains limited. In this study, our aims to describe the design, development and usability evaluation process of a management platform (Hyper-DREAM) for hypertension. Our multidisciplinary team employed an iterative design approach over the course of a year to develop the Hyper-DREAM platform. This platform's primary functionalities encompass multimodal data collection (personal hypertensive digital phenotype archive), multimodal interventions (BP measurement, medication assistance, behavior modification, and hypertension education) and multimodal interactions (clinician-patient engagement and BP Coach component). In August 2024, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was conducted involving 51 hypertensive patients recruited from three distinct centers. In parallel, six clinicians engaged in management activities and contributed feedback via the Doctor’s Software Satisfaction Questionnaire (DSSQ). Concurrently, a real-world comparative experiment was conducted to evaluate the usability of the BP Coach, ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o and clinicians. The comparative experiment demonstrated that the BP Coach achieved significantly higher scores in utility (mean scores 4.05, SD 0.87) and completeness (mean scores 4.12, SD 0.78) when compared to ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o, and clinicians. In terms of clarity, the BP Coach was slightly lower than clinicians (mean scores 4.03, SD 0.88). In addition, the BP Coach exhibited lower performance in conciseness (mean scores 3.00, SD 0.96). Clinicians reported a marked improvement in work efficiency (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001) and experienced faster and more effective patient interactions (3.0 vs. 4.17, P =.004). Furthermore, the Hyper-DREAM platform significantly decreased work intensity (2.5 vs. 3.5, P =.01) and minimized disruptions to daily routines (2.33 vs. 3.55, P =.004). The Hyper-DREAM platform demonstrated significantly greater overall satisfaction compared to the WeChat-based standard management (3.33 vs. 4.17, P =.01). Additionally, clinicians exhibited a markedly higher willingness to integrate the Hyper-DREAM platform into clinical practice (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001). Furthermore, patient management time decreased from 11.5 min (SD 1.87) with Wechat-based standard management to 7.5 min (SD 1.84, P =.01) with Hyper-DREAM. Hypertensive patients reported high satisfaction with the Hyper-DREAM platform, including ease of use (mean scores 1.60, SD 0.69), system information arrangement (mean scores 1.69, SD 0.71), and usefulness (mean scores 1.57, SD 0.58). In conclusion, our study presents Hyper-DREAM, a novel artificial intelligence-driven platform for hypertension management, designed to alleviate clinician workload and exhibiting significant promise for clinical application. The Hyper-DREAM platform is distinguished by its user-friendliness, high satisfaction rates, utility, and effective organization of information. Furthermore, the BP Coach component underscores the potential of LLMs in advancing mHealth approaches to hypertension management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - In modern business, maintaining competitiveness and efficiency necessitates the integration of state-of-the-art technology. This paper introduces the Artificial Intelligence Procurement Assistant (AIPA), an advanced system co-developed with Solita, a Finnish software company. AIPA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data analytics to enhance the assessment of procurement call bids and funding opportunities. The system incorporates LLM agents to enhance user interactions, from intelligent search execution to results evaluation. Rigorous usability testing and real-world evaluation, conducted in collaboration with our industry partner, validated AIPA’s intuitive interface, personalized search functionalities, and effective results filtering. The platform significantly streamlines the identification of optimal calls by synergizing LLMs with resources from the European Commission TED and other portals. Feedback from the company guided essential refinements, particularly in the performance of ChatGPT agents for tasks like translation and keyword extraction. Further contributing to its scalability and adaptability, AIPA has been made open-source, inviting community contributions for its ongoing refinement and enhancement. Future developments will focus on extensive case studies, iterative improvements through user feedback, and expanding data sources to further elevate its utility in streamlining and optimizing procurement processes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study explores the use of LLMs for providing quantitative zero-shot sentiment analysis of implicit software desirability, addressing a critical challenge in product evaluation where traditional review scores, though convenient, fail to capture the richness of qualitative user feedback. Innovations include establishing a method that 1) works with qualitative user experience data without the need for explicit review scores, 2) focuses on implicit user satisfaction, and 3) provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of user sentiment, instead of simply classifying sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. Data is collected using the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of two software systems. PDT data was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment, and Vader, a leading sentiment analysis tool. Each system was asked to evaluate the data in two ways, by looking at the sentiment expressed in the PDT word/explanation pairs; and by looking at the sentiment expressed by the users in their grouped selection of five words and explanations, as a whole. Numerical analysis is used to provide insights into the magnitude of sentiment to drive high quality decisions regarding product desirability. Each LLM is asked to provide its confidence (low, medium, high) in its sentiment score, along with an explanation of its score. All LLMs tested were able to statistically detect user sentiment from the users' grouped data, whereas TRBS and Vader were not. The confidence and explanation of confidence provided by the LLMs assisted in understanding user sentiment. This study adds deeper understanding of evaluating user experiences, toward the goal of creating a universal tool that quantifies implicit sentiment. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the use of large language models, in this case the ChatGPT API, as simulated users to evaluate designed, rule-based conversations. This type of evaluation can be introduced as a low-cost method to identify common usability issues prior to testing conversational agents with actual users. Preliminary findings show that ChatGPT is good at playing the part of a user, providing realistic testing scenarios for designed conversations even if these involve certain background knowledge or context. GPT-4 shows vast improvements over ChatGPT (3.5). In future work, it is important to evaluate the performance of simulated users in a more structured, generalizable manner, for example by comparing their behavior to that of actual users. In addition, ways to fine-tune the LLM could be explored to improve its performance, and the output of simulated conversations could be analyzed to automatically derive usability metrics such as the number of turns needed to reach the goal. Finally, the use of simulated users with open-ended conversational agents could be explored, where the LLM may also be able to reflect on the user experience of the conversation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - In software maintenance, concise summaries of bug reports are crucial, significantly enhancing developer efficiency and ultimately improving software quality and user experience. Large language models (LLMs) have become the standard method for bug report summarization due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, LLM-based approaches face two primary challenges: accurately modeling the contextual relationships between various components within a bug report and the risk of overfitting when fine-tuning LLMs on datasets of limited size. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, SumLLaMA, which leverages contrastive learning pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Contrastive learning pre-training is employed to construct contextual relations between components in a single bug report, enabling SumLLaMA to learn sequence-level representations. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we fine-tune a smaller adapter instead of the entire LLM, reducing the number of parameters trained to about 1/1500 of the original model, effectively mitigating the risk of overfitting. To evaluate the effectiveness of SumLLaMA, we compare it against five baseline models, including a state-of-the-art model, on a publicly available dataset. The experimental results show that SumLLaMA outperforms all baselines by up to 26.66, 17.10, and 24.01 points in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, achieving a state-of-the-art result for automated bug report summarization. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based applications are gaining prominence due to their ability to leverage large language models (LLMs). These systems excel at combining retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities, resulting in contextually relevant responses that enhance user experience. In particular, Transurban, a road operation company, replaced its rule-based virtual assistant (VA) with a RAG-based VA (RAGVA) to offer flexible customer interactions and support a wider range of scenarios. This paper presents an experience report from Transurban's engineering team on building and deploying a RAGVA, offering a step-by-step guide for creating a conversational application and engineering a RAGVA. The report serves as a reference for future researchers and practitioners. While the engineering processes for traditional software applications are well-established, the development and evaluation of RAG-based applications are still in their early stages, with numerous emerging challenges remaining uncharted. To address this gap, we conduct a focus group study with Transurban practitioners regarding developing and evaluating their RAGVA. We identified eight challenges encountered by the engineering team and proposed eight future directions that should be explored to advance the development of RAG-based applications. This study contributes to the foundational understanding of a RAG-based conversational application and the emerging AI software engineering challenges it presents. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - With the recent development of the Virtual Reality (VR) industry, the increasing number of VR users pushes the demand for the massive production of immersive and expressive VR scenes in related industries. However, creating expressive VR scenes involves the reasonable organization of various digital content to express a coherent and logical theme, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT 3.5 and generative models such as stable diffusion have emerged as powerful tools for comprehending natural language and generating digital contents such as text, code, images, and 3D objects. In this paper, we have explored how we can generate VR scenes from text by incorporating LLMs and various generative models into an automated system. To achieve this, we first identify the possible limitations of LLMs for an automated system and propose a systematic framework to mitigate them. Subsequently, we developed Text2VRScene, a VR scene generation system, based on our proposed framework with well-designed prompts. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and the designed prompts, we carry out a series of test cases. The results show that the proposed framework contributes to improving the reliability of the system and the quality of the generated VR scenes. The results also illustrate the promising performance of the Text2VRScene in generating satisfying VR scenes with a clear theme regularized by our well-designed prompts. This paper ends with a discussion about the limitations of the current system and the potential of developing similar generation systems based on our framework. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. Traditionally, automating GUI interactions relied on script-based or rule-based approaches, which, while effective for fixed workflows, lacked the flexibility and adaptability required for dynamic, real-world applications. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, task generalization, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of “LLM-brained” GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry. To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-powered GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address critical research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of fine-tuned models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-powered GUI agents. We anticipate that this survey will serve both as a practical cookbook for constructing LLM-powered GUI agents, and as a definitive reference for advancing research in this rapidly evolving domain. The collection of papers reviewed in this survey will be hosted and regularly updated on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/vyokky/LLM-Brained-GUI-Agents-Survey.

AB  - Effective query-item relevance modeling is pivotal for enhancing user experience and safeguarding user satisfaction in e-commerce search systems. Recently, benefiting from the vast inherent knowledge, Large Language Model (LLM) approach demonstrates strong performance and long-tail generalization ability compared with previous neural-based specialized relevance learning methods. Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following inadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational demands make it difficult to be deployed online. Second, distilling LLM models to online models is a feasible direction, but the LLM relevance modeling is a black box, and its rich intrinsic knowledge is difficult to extract and apply online. To improve the interpretability of LLM and boost the performance of online relevance models via LLM, we propose an Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation framework for e-commerce relevance learning, which comprises two core components: (1) An Explainable LLM for relevance modeling (ELLM-rele), which decomposes the relevance learning into intermediate steps and models relevance learning as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, thereby enhancing both interpretability and performance of LLM. (2) A Multi-dimensional Knowledge Distillation (MKD) architecture that transfers the knowledge of ELLM-rele to current deployable interaction-based and representation-based student models from both the relevance score distribution and CoT reasoning aspects. Through distilling the probabilistic and CoT reasoning knowledge, MKD improves both the semantic interaction and long-tail generalization abilities of student models. Extensive offline evaluations and online experiments on Taobao search ad scene demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances e-commerce relevance learning performance and user experience. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Cross-site scripting attacks represent one of the major security threats facing web applications, with Stored XSS attacks becoming the predominant form. Compared to reflected XSS, stored XSS attack payloads exhibit temporal and spatial asynchrony between injection and execution, rendering traditional browserside defenses based on request-response differential analysis ineffective. This paper presents XSShield, the first detection framework that leverages a Large Language Model to understand JavaScript semantics to defend against Stored XSS attacks. Through a Prompt Optimizer based on gradient descent and UCB-R selection algorithms, and a Data Adaptor based on program dependence graphs, the framework achieves real-time and fine-grained code processing. Experimental evaluation shows that XSShield achieves 93% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9266 on the GPT-4 model, improving accuracy by an average of 88.8% compared to existing solutions. The processing time, excluding model communication overhead, averages only 0.205 s, demonstrating practical deployability without significantly impacting user experience. © 2025 by the authors.
